# Functional Programming Labs

This repository contains solutions and exercises for a university course on functional programming using Haskell.

## Structure

- `lab1/` to `lab6/`: Each directory contains exercises and practice files for a specific lab session.

## Topics Covered

- Basic Haskell syntax and functions
- Pattern matching and recursion
- Higher-order functions and function composition
- Data types: product, sum, enum, and newtype
- Type classes: `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Functor`
- IO operations and monads
- Custom data structures (Stack, Queue, BST)
- List comprehensions and sorting algorithms

## How to Run

To run an exercise, use:

```sh
ghc labX/exercises/exY.hs -o exY && ./exY
```

Or run with ```runghc```:

```sh
runghc labX/exercises/exY.hs
```

Replace `labX` and `exY` with the appropriate lab and exercise numbers.

## Requirements

- [GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](Collecting workspace information```markdown
# Funkcyjne - Functional Programming Labs

This repository contains solutions and exercises for a university course on functional programming, primarily using Haskell.

## Structure

- `lab1/` to `lab7/`: Each directory contains exercises and practice files for a specific lab session.
  - `exercise.hs`, `practice1.hs`, `theory.hs`: Main files for each lab.
  - `exercises/`: Subdirectory with individual exercise files (`ex1.hs`, `ex2.hs`, ...).

## Topics Covered

- Basic Haskell syntax and functions
- Pattern matching and recursion
- Higher-order functions and function composition
- Data types: product, sum, enum, and newtype
- Type classes: `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Functor`
- IO operations and monads
- Custom data structures (Stack, Queue, BST)
- List comprehensions and sorting algorithms

## How to Run

To run an exercise, use:

```sh
ghc labX/exercises/exY.hs -o exY && ./exY
```

Or run with `runghc`:

```sh
runghc labX/exercises/exY.hs
```

Replace `labX` and `exY` with the appropriate lab and exercise numbers.

## Requirements

- [GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
- Basic knowledge of Haskell
